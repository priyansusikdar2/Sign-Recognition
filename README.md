# 🧠 Real-Time Sign Language Recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

This project is a **real-time sign language recognition system** built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **NumPy**, using **no external datasets or machine learning models**. It uses hand landmark detection and rule-based geometry to recognize basic sign language gestures like `A`, `B`, `L`, `Y`, `V`, etc.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎯 Real-time webcam-based hand gesture recognition.
- ✋ Tracks **21 hand landmarks** using MediaPipe.
- 🧠 Classifies gestures using geometric rules (angles, distances).
- 🖐 Recognizes letters: **A, B, L, Y, V, W** and numbers like **1**.
- 🪄 No dataset or training required — works offline.
- 📋 On-screen finger labeling and gesture display.
